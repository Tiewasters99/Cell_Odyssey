This is a video game about the adventures of a nanocamera named Cammie, piloted by a young 14-year old named Tom, working with a scientitist named Dr. Chen, to adventure in the innermost realm of a human cell braving cytoplasmic currents and ruthless bacterial invaders to take the first ever close-up photographs of the Golgi Apparatus and transmit them to scientists working on a cure for Alzheimers.
